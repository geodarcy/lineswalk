This project is mapping Line's tweets during her El Camino walk in 2014. The html and json files are actually being copied over and hosted on www.ecmaps.ca.

Should anyone actually read this, any efforts to pretty-up the map by adding an information header or properly configuring the pop-up to handle the images would be appreciated.
